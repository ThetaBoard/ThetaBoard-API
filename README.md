Authentication
==============

If you're making a private integration with ThetaBoard for your own purposes, you can use HTTP Basic authentication. This is secure since all requests in the new Basecamp use SSL.

If you're making a public integration with ThetaBoard, you must use OAuth 2. This allows users to authorize your application to use Basecamp on their behalf without having to copy/paste API tokens or touch sensitive login info.

Read the authentication guide to get started.
